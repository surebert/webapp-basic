<title>Surebert &trade; Javascript Toolkit</title>
<meta name="description" content="Paul Visco's Surebert &trade; is a complete solution for developing highly interactive javascript based client side applications. Surebert handles most of the inconsistencies between the major browsing platforms (IE, firefox and Safari) allowing the programmer to concentrate on what they want to accomplish instead of the tedious labor of how to make their code work in all the browsers. Surebert's style of javascripting encourages a clean separation of content, design and interactive scripting - making script upkeep, sharing, and debugging easier to handle. Surebert has been continuously developed and tested since September of 2004." />

<h1>Beginning A Surebert Framework</h1>
<p>If you have questions you can email paul.visco AT roswellpark.org</p>
<ol>

<li>
<div>
<p>To begin, make sure that you have a copy of the surebert framework deployed to your server.  Ani, obi, billy, and the fedora vmware image already have it installed in <b>/var/www/sbf</b>  You can find up to date deployment intructions on the <a href="http://wiki.surebert.com/index.php/Framework:quickstart_guide">surebert framework quickstart guide</a>.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li>
<div>Next, set your SUREBERT_FRAMEWORK_SB_PATH in /private/config/definitions.php so that it matches the path that the sbf is deployed at. e.g.
<pre>
define("SUREBERT_FRAMEWORK_SB_PATH", "/var/www/sbf/sb/1.0");
</pre>
</div>
</li>

<li>
<div>Next, set your SUREBERT_TOOLKIT_PATH in /private/config/definitions.php so that it matches the path that the sbf is deployed at. e.g.
<pre>
define("SUREBERT_TOOLKIT_PATH", "/var/www/sbf/toolkit/4.64");
</pre>
</div>
</li>

<li>
<div>OPTIONAL: If using Roswell Park rp modules, set your SUREBERT_FRAMEWORK_RP_PATH in /private/config/definitions.php so that it matches the path that the sbf is deployed at. e.g.
<pre>
define("SUREBERT_FRAMEWORK_RP_PATH", "/var/www/sbf/rp/1.0");
</pre>
</div>
</li>

<li>
<div>Finally, In order to get rid of this page, you need to go ahead and edit /public/.htaccess and comment change
<pre>RewriteRule .* index.html</pre>
to
<pre>#RewriteRule .* index.html</pre>

TIP: You can use this index.html as a static placeholder in an emergency, say if your DB is down.  You may want to keep it around and remember what to uncomment to turn it back on!
